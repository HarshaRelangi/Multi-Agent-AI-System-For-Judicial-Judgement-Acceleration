Subject: Project Update - Mobile App Development

Hi Jane,

I wanted to update you on the progress of the mobile app project. 
We're running into some challenges with the Android compatibility 
issues we discussed last week. The team suggests we need additional 
resources to meet the March 15 deadline.

Key concerns:
1. Third-party API integration is taking longer than expected
2. We need to add 2 more developers to the team
3. Budget may need to be increased by $25,000

I recommend a meeting with stakeholders to discuss these changes.

Best regards,
John Doe

John,

I appreciate the update. However, I must insist on meeting the 
original deadline and budget constraints. The project cannot be 
extended or over budget.

Please find a solution within current resources.

Regards,
Jane Smith
Director of Engineering
ABC Corporation

Hi Michael,

Given the recent developments at ABC Corp, I'm exploring new 
opportunities. I have extensive experience in the mobile app 
space you're working in. Would you be interested in discussing 
a potential role?

I can share insights from our current project architecture.

Best,
John Doe
